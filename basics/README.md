# Reinforcement learning basics

This folder contains (or rather, will contain) tutorial notebooks covering basic aspects of reinforcement learning (RL).

For more details on everything discussed here, take a look at Sutton and Barto's classic RL textbook. Often considered the 'bible' of RL, it is a must-read if you are serious about learning the subject.
